Project_1: CustomDate.java


This project will take a CustomDate object with dates then determine if the date is valid and perform some operations on that date such as , setting/getting the date fields(month,day,year), advancing the date by one day/week and determining whether the year passed is a leap year or not!


Project Specs:
   O - NO println/print statements anywhere in the CustomDate class.
   O - throw an IllegalArgumentException if the date is invalid.
   O - To correctly override the equals method of the Object class, the method should return false if the argument is null or not of the            same class.
   O - In the compareTo method, if the argument is null or not of the same class, a comparison cannot be made. In this case, throw new      IllegalArgumentException("Only two CustomDate objects can be compared").
